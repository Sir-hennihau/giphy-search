# Giphy Search

[Here](https://sir-hennihau.github.io/giphy-search/) you can see a live demo.

This is a React frontend for requesting GIFs from the Giphy API.

It features:

- Trending GIFs
- Searching GIFs
- Infinite scrolling

# Motivation

I created this project to demonstrate how I approach coding. It is used to preview my skills as a React developer during my current application process (January 2021).

# Technology

The following technologies were used building Giphy Search:

- React
- React context
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- Giphy's API

Since the scope of this project was small, I used React's context API instead of Redux here. For configuration, I used most of the default values from create-react-app. The project uses a free tier key for network requests to the Giphy API.
